NAME
    Nginx::Redis - asynchronous redis client for nginx-perl

SYNOPSIS
        use Nginx::Redis;
    
        ngx_redis '127.0.0.1:6379', ['GET', 'mykey'], sub {
            my ($reply) = @_;
        
            unless ($reply) {
                warn "error: no reply from redis\n";
                return;
            }
        
            # $reply = ['$', 'myvalue']
        };

DESCRIPTION
    Fast asynchronous redis client for nginx-perl that supports pipelining
    and doesn't provide any command-bound interface. You can use it for
    almost any feature of redis. Currently it doesn't support pub/sub-like
    flow though.

    Nginx::Redis relies on Redis::Parser::XS to parse reply messages. So you
    have to install it as well.

EXPORT
        ngx_redis
        ngx_redis_client
        ngx_redis_request

FUNCTIONS
    ngx_redis "$ip:$port:$auth:$timeout", ['GET', 'mykey'], sub { };
        Encodes and sends request to the redis server specified by
        "$ip:$port". If password is specified in $auth then AUTH command
        will precede.

        Calls back with reply in $_[0]. Format of the reply described in
        Redis::Parser::XS.

        On error calls back without any arguments. Tries to reconnect on the
        next request.

        Every connection is cached forever.

        Example:

            ngx_redis '127.0.0.1', ['PING'], sub {
                my ($reply) = @_;
                
                # $reply = ['+', 'PONG']
            };
